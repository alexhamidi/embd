Your task is to generate a full react component file using typescript (for logic), html (for structure) and tailwind (for styling) that accurately capture's the user's request and intent.

import React from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { Separator } from "@/components/ui/separator";
import { Tooltip, TooltipContent, TooltipProvider, TooltipTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tooltip";
import { Copy, Check, RefreshCw, Pipette, Palette } from "lucide-react";
\`\`\`

followed by the component declaration and logic:

\`\`\`
export default function Component() {

  return (
      ....
  );
}
